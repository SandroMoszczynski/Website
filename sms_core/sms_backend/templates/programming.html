		<h3>Python</h3>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">I started learning Python in my second year of my BSc in 2012. I have used it ever since
			for a multidue of projects. During my time at Sussexs I mostly used python as a data analysis tool utilising
			libraries such as Numpy and Matplotlib.
		</p><br>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">During my time at UCL I used Python in most of my classes and for my MSc project. I
			learned how to parallelise my code to multiple CPU cores and even how one would go about sending off some
			calculations to a GPU. In addition to this I learned some Tensorflow and learned a lot about how Python can
			interact with running processes on Windows and Linux and how to manipulate these, this was most applicable
			to my MSc project as that mostly ran through command line. Other topics I learned include how to create a
			library that would be available to download through Python and the use of Pandas, Numba and OpenCL. I also
			made extensive use of Jupyter notebooks, as can be seen in my GitHub links below.
		</p><br>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">Working for Mo-Sys I have had ample opportunity to work on a wide range of python
			projects. These included creating and maintaining website with Django, using the Oauth toolkits to manage
			our security through our sites, using Django-Oscar to create a shop for our company, creating a multitude of
			api endpoints for our cloud systems to communicate with and general production level python code for our
			piplines to run one.
		</p><br>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">Python to me is the epitome of an easy to use programming solution. With a few commands I
			can open up a Jupyter Notebook and quickly test whatever small piece of code I just realised I need make
			work. Even for larger projects with tools like Numba and OOP to keep code organised one can create fast and
			neat code that runs almost as quickly as a compiled language.
		</p>

		<h3>Version Control and Dev-Ops</h3>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">Ancilliary to this I was taught how to use GitHub at university, outside of which I have
			continued to use for both this website and other pesonal projects. At my current position at Mo-Sys we have
			our own gitlab server that we use as the core to most of our version control.
		</p><br>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">However as Mo-Sys is a company that works within the film and media industry, we make use
			of Perfoce for some of our projects and production chains. As such I have a fair ammount of experience using
			both the frontend ui and console commands in production enviroments.
		</p><br>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">On the Dev-Ops side of Git I have created a large portion of our unit tests for our
			pipline at Mo-Sys and our Integration test. If a merge is made to a main branch on one of our repos, it will
			trigger an integration test using all of the relevant branches mentioned in that commit. We also use an
			intermediate git repository for our services, such that if our main server goes down or is unreachable for
			any reason, our services wont be interrupted.
		</p>

		<h3>C++</h3>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">During my MSc at UCL I took an advanced course in Research with C++ and as such had to
			rapidly teach myself basic to intermediate C++. I managed to do so and learned a lot through the process.
			All the assessed problems used Travis as a continuous integration and testing platform for my code. I will
			be starting on a C++ personal project soon to keep my skills up and hopefully learn many new ones.
		</p><br>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">What I enjoy about C++ is its ability to give the maximum performance possible out of a
			piece of code with comparatively simple integration of parallelisation and GPU support. As my only learned
			compiled language it is also the best way for me to share any pieces of work with outside non-programmers
			as it doesnt require having Python installed.
		</p>

		<h4>AWS</h4>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">AWS infastructure is used as the core basis for the cloud rendering service I have worked 
			on. As such I have extensive experience with with most ec2 functions. This includes creating, launching and
			general management of instances, working through parameter store to keep important information secure but 
			available, storing files in s3 as central hub of the system and some use of lambda functions. I also have 
			experience with some of the more sys admin parts of aws, namly management of vpc's, network interfaces, 
			security groups, Iamroles, permissions etc.
		</p>
		<p class="p_thinner_2">Most of these commands have been issued through the use of the python module Boto, with
			some run directly through command line, and general mangement through the web interface. I also have a lot 
			of experience with unit testing these through the python module moto. 
		</p>

		<h4>JavaScript</h4>
		<p class="p_thinner">Since starting work at my Mo-Sys I have had had ample opportunityto work with JavaScript.
			One of the larger pieces dealth with dynamically creating a webpage from returned api endpoint data. This
			included autocomplete search bars that returned back to Django endpoints.
		</p>

		<h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
		<p class="p_thinner">This website is coded from scratch by myself. No outside creative suite like Square Space,
			Wicks or Wordpress was used. I taught myself both css and html through Codeacademy and then used Visual
			Studio Code to write it all. A GitHub link to the source code can be seen 
			<a href="https://github.com/SandroMoszczynski/Website" id="normal_link">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p class="p_thinner">Proffesionally I have been somewhere midway between a front and back end developer at my
			position at Mo-Sys. Mostly working at the backend with Django, but creating/editing pages and css stylings
			where necessary.
		</p>

		<h4>Databases</h4>
		<p class="p_thinner">For Mo-Sys' cloud render system we officially support MySql Postgress and Sqlite as a 
			database option. I have experience working with these three through direct server commands but mostly
			through Django and the python module Peewee.
		</p>

		<h4>WINDOWS</h4>
		<p class="p_thinner">I have been using windows since I was a child, and am extreamly familiar with standard
			operations performed on it. At Mo-Sys we use them as our corerender nodes, which means using unprivellaged
			users to launch python scripts and Unreal engine through user data and startup scripts. This requires 
			knowledge of permissions and formatting drives through powershell commands aswell as auto git updates etc.
		</p>

		<h4>LINUX</h4>
		<p class="p_thinner">I first Used linux at university, for c++ and other projects. I currently have linux 
			dual booted on all of the machines I own. At work we use linux boxes for all of our websites (hosted on
			aws). We again have to contend with unprivellaged users setting up sites on startup and automatically 
			pulling from git, which requires a lot of permission changes and symlinking of files. I also have 
			experience using linux boxes as control hubs for cloud systems through database operations and api 
			endpoints. 
		</p>

		<h4>MATLAB</h4>
		<p class="p_thinner">
			2 years of undergraduate experience working in labs.
		</p>

		<h4>LATEX</h4>
		<p class="p_thinner">
			Many years of experience formatting documents. For examples see copies of my thesis and cv's in my
			employment history <a href="{% url 'sms_backend:cv' %}" id="normal_link">here</a>. All 4 of the
			available downloads were made with latex, with my most recent dissertation from UCL using a number
			of from-scratch built vector images for LaTeX.
		</p>

		<h4>MS/OPEN OFFICE + GOOGLE WORKSPACE</h4>
		<p class="p_thinner">Very comfortable with Word, Excel, Office, Powerpoint and their equivalents from Google and
			Open Office with extensive experience in each. Used Excel at both of my Technician positions to tally the
			whole school's science results for each year. Also have experience using and making light macros for Excel,
			which have been used for polynomial fit macros with laboratory work at Sussex.

				<h4>Description</h4>
				<div class="sub-item">This was an assessed project from UCL. After installing the modules from Python
					repositories one could ask the program to recommend the best bus route from various locations.
					This was all accessible through command line. One could also see a number of statistics such as
					bus route and graphical data on passenger density.
				</div>
				<div class="sub-item">This was a personal project worked on for my D&D tabletop group. The campaign I
					was working on took place in a cold tundra like environment above the arctic circle. Thus I created
					a simple Python program that runs through command line and calculates weather, temperature, snowfall
					and gives the amount of expected sunlight (if any) on a specified day.
				</div>
				<div class="sub-item">My MSc project code. This code was adapted from various papers and tailored to my
					needs. The project used a machine learning agent from the projective simulation branch of
					reinforcement learning to optimise surface codes of Quantum memory. The agent was free to run a
					c program that simulated a quantum computer's memory. This program would test a surface code and
					output the results into a txt file that my agent waited for and then read. It would then deliberate
					on the results and output a new command to the surface code program through command line. This
					would continue until the surface code passed a stability threshold that had been preset, or the
					number of allowed moves had been passed.
				</div>
				<div class="sub-item">This was an assessed project from UCL. The task was to optimise a mathematical
					clustering problem from code given to us. We were then asked to run performance analyses between
					the optimised and non-optimised code and output performance data on it.
				</div>
				<div class="sub-item">This is a repository with all my practice notebooks from the last few months. Some
					are from Codeacademy or Hackerranks challenges, some are tests from companies that I wanted to
					improve on afterwords, all could be much better organised.
				</div>
				<div class="sub-item">This was an assessed project from UCL. These are my High Performance Computing
					notebooks, specifically ones devoted to 2 optimisation problems. The first was a random walk
					generator over many thousands of steps that I optimised to use multiple cpu cores in Python.
					The second was a physics equation relating to point charges that was similarly optimised.
				</div>
				<div class="sub-item">This will be an as yet unnamed Python project that will use a machine learning
					agent to suggest new clothes to a user from websites.

				<h4>Description</h4>
				<div class="sub-item_2">This was an assessed problem from UCl. It focused on creating a simulation of
					many pedestrians in a box. It used physical models of how pedestrians move in crowds to simulate
					an area around each person where they would not want to walk into each other. The model was also
					optimised using parallelisation through multiple cpu cores and gave a readout of compute times
					with various settings. The program could simulate two types of pedestrians, the first is moving
					continuously forward unless bumped into and the second was going to a set destination on the map.
					The model could support various sizes of bounding box with many thousands of pedestrians and a
					visualiser to show their locations (although good luck keeping track of one pedestrian with many
					thousands of dots).
				</div>
				<div class="sub-item">This was an assessed problem from UCL. It focused on writing a batch gradient
