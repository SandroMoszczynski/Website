        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p class="p_thinner_2">I started learning Python in my second year of my BSc in 2012. Since then I have used it for many years with varying degrees of expertise. During my
          BSc I became familiar with Numpy and Matplotlib in regular use for my second and third year laboratory projects, although this was limited in comparison 
          to my current standard of coding.
          </p><br>
        <p class="p_thinner_2">During my time at UCL I used Python in most of my classes and for my MSc project. I learned how to parallelise my code to multiple CPU cores and 
          even how one would go about sending off some calculations to a GPU. In addition to this I learned some Tensorflow and learned a lot about how Python can interact 
          with running processes on Windows and Linux and how to manipulate these, this was most applicable to my MSc project as that mostly ran through command line. Other topics I 
          learned include how to create a library that would be available to download through Python and the use of Pandas, Numba and OpenCL. I also made extensive use of Jupyter 
          notebooks, as can be seen in my GitHub links below.
          </p><br>
        <p class="p_thinner_2">During this time I was taught how to use GitHub, which I have continued to use for both this website and other pesonal projects. 
          It was also extensively used unit testing, with 2 of the projects listed below making use of Continuous Integration through Travis and GitHub.
          </p><br>
        <p class="p_thinner_2">While the class functionality of Python is not inherent to it, I have made use of OOP with Python in both my project and through classwork. However due 
          to its slightly clunky implementation I only use them for projects where keeping a neat and organised flow of functions is necessary.
          </p><br>
        <p class="p_thinner_2">Python to me is the epitome of an easy to use programming solution. With a few commands I can open up a Jupyter Notebook 
          and quickly test whatever small piece of code I just realised I need make work. Even for larger projects with tools like Numba and OOP to keep organised one can create 
          fast and neat code that runs almost as quickly as a compiled language. 
          </p>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <div class="sub-item">This was an assessed project from UCL. After installing the modules from Python repositories one could
              ask the program to recommend the best bus route from various locations. This was all accessible through command line. One could
              also see a number of statistics such as bus route and graphical data on passenger density.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">This was a personal project worked on for my D&D tabletop group. The campaign I was working on took place in a cold tundra
              like environment above the arctic circle. Thus I created a simple Python program that runs through command line and calculates weather,
              temperature, snowfall and gives the amount of expected sunlight (if any) on a specified day. 
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">My MSc project code. This code was adapted from various papers and tailored to my needs. The project used a machine learning 
              agent from the projective simulation branch of reinforcement learning to optimise surface codes of quantum memory. The agent was free to run a 
              c program that simulated a quantum computer's memory. This program would test a surface code and output the results into a txt file that my agent
              waited for and then read. It would then deliberate on the results and output a new command to the surface code program through command line. This 
              would continue until the surface code passed a stability threshold that had been preset, or the number of allowed moves had been passed.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">This was an assessed project from UCL. The task was to optimise a mathematical clustering problem from code given to us. We 
              were then asked to run performance analyses between the optimised and non-optimised code and output performance data on it.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">This is a repository with all my practice notebooks from the last few months. Some are from Codeacademy or Hackerranks
              challenges, some are tests from companies that I wanted to improve on afterwords, all could be much better organised.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">This was an assessed project from UCL. These are my High Performance Computing notebooks, specifically ones devoted to 2 
              optimisation problems. The first was a random walk generator over many thousands of steps that I optimised to use multiple cpu cores in Python. 
              The second was a physics equation relating to point charges that was similarly optimised. 
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">This will be an as yet unnamed Python project that will use a machine learning agent to suggest new clothes
              to a user from websites.

        <h3>C++</h3>
        <p class="p_thinner_2">During my MSc at UCL I took an advanced course in Research with C++ and as such had to rapidly teach myself basic to intermediate C++. I managed to do 
          so and learned a lot through the process. All the assessed problems used Travis as a continuous integration and testing platform for my code. I will 
          be starting on a C++ personal project soon to keep my skills up and hopefully learn many new ones.
        </p><br>
        <p class="p_thinner_2">What I enjoy about C++ is its ability to give the maximum performance possible out of a piece of code with comparatively simple 
          integration of parallelisation and GPU support. As my only learned compiled language it is also the best way for me to share any pieces of work with 
          outside non-programmers as it doesnt require having Python installed.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <div class="sub-item_2">This was an assessed problem from UCl. It focused on creating a simulation of many pedestrians in a box. It used 
              physical models of how pedestrians move in crowds to simulate an area around each person where they would not want to walk into each
              other. The model was also optimised using parallelisation through multiple cpu cores and gave a readout of compute times with various settings.
              The program could simulate two types of pedestrians, the first is moving continuously forward unless bumped into and the second was going 
              to a set destination on the map. The model could support various sizes of bounding box with many thousands of pedestrians and a visualiser
              to show their locations (although good luck keeping track of one pedestrian with many thousands of dots).
