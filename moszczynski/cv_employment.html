          <p>University College London &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; Sep 2019 - Sep 2020</p>
          <p><strong>Key modules:</strong> Quantum Communication, Machine Learning with Big Data, Research with C++ and Python.</p>
          <p class="p_thinner">My Quantum Technologies Masters focused on two main areas. Programming and Quantum Computing. For 
            the former I took modules that taught me valuable Python and C++ principles and techniques, as well as giving me knowledge
            of machine learning algorithms. For the Quantum Computing I took modules which dealt mostly with the theoretical side of 
            the field. Although some practical applications were explored in my project.
          </p><br>
          <p class="p_thinner">This project focused on applying machine learning techniques to quantum error correction, specifically on working with
            topological codes. The project was based in Python with elements extending to C. An algorithm based on projective
            simulation papers was created for use with this project. The machine learning agent that was created looked at noisy quantum 
            memory through surface codes, and searched through possible variations to find an optimal one.

          <p><strong>Key modules:</strong> Quantum Field Theory, Symmetries in Particle Physics, Data Analysis Techniques.</p>
          <p class="p_thinner">Most of the classes taken for this Masters were relevant to theoretical particle physics. Complex mathematical 
            courses such as Quantum Field Theory, Group Theory and modules that dealt with physics beyond the Standard Model. Added to this was 
            a comprehensive course on statistical physics, one that would be valuable knowledge for any data scientist position.
          </p><br>
          <p  class="p_thinner">My dissertation took the premise of Supersymmetry and simplified the concepts to a single U(1) gauge, estimates
            of particle content were then made.

            <p>Oasis Academy Arena</p>
            <p> I was employed as the sole technician in this secondary school. My responsibilities included ensuring all experiments
              have risk assessments and all stock is safely stored, including radioactive materials. I also delivered experiments for
              all three sciences and helped instruct pupils and teachers in how to best use the equipment we have.</p>
            <p>This was the first year the school was operating with experiments, thus the role required me to order in most of the 
              chemicals and equipment needed for these. It also required setting up the health and safety protocols of the department.
              I was also asked to assist with other areas of health and safety protocol, namely food tech.

            <p>I was employed as a technician at this secondary school. My duties revolved around preparing practicals and being
              the physics specialist in the school. This required me to set up new practicals and explain physical problems to the teachers
              as well as setting up clubs involving science and engineering.</p>
            <p>Due to my experience with a professional cooking enviroment I voluntary took up extra duties as a food tech technician, 
              helping in classes and writing some of the risk assessments for this department.

            <p>The Departmental Joint Committee (DJC) is the regular meeting of the Physics and Astronomy department heads with the elected student body
              representatives. As secretary I took minutes and organised rooms and meeting times as well as kept both lectures and students updated on
              their designated tasks. On top of this I played a large part in organising the annual physics ball. Each year the event was sold out with
               over 150 people attending each time. The ball featured prizes for lecturers from student voted categories and nominations, raffles of prizes 
              such as textbooks for students donated from various sources and guest speakers from prominent scientific institutions.</p>

            <p>The physics society at Sussex (QSoc) was widely praised for helping students interact with each other after I took over. We
              organised social events such as LAN parties, quizzes and other meet and greets which helped make the department a close-knit community. 
              As president it was my duty to oversee all the submembers and make sure the organisation ran smoothly, on top of keeping enough money to allow 
              for more social events.

              <li>University Experience</li>
              <p class="p_thinner">For my most recent Masters project I underwent a Viva or defence of my dissertation, this was on top of a presentation on a solo article

                distinguished researchers on my dissertation topic. I also gave smaller talks and presentations during my undergraduate degree. 
              </p>
              <p>For my most recent Masters I was required to search for an external supervisor, and as such this required contacting numerous institutions looking for Masters
