        <h4>Cooking</h4>
        <p>Most of the chefs I've met or read about have stories of how they cooking with a parental figure from a young age, 
          which nurtured their interest in the subject. My interest came about from an almost opposite direction. I have memories
          of making cakes when I was younger but my interest really started when I started cooking meals for myself.
        </p><br>
        <p>This interest was given a golden opportunity shortyly before university when I found a job as a kitchen porter at a north 
          london tratorie. The hours were long and the journey took over an hour but it really fed into my passion as I was given the 
          opportunity to assist in preperation and eventually took on a role more closely resembelling a commis chef. 
        </p><br>
        <P>However I eventually decided to keep with my decision to go to university instead of the culinary arts, although my interest 
          in the subject remained and I spent the next few years developing more skills. Since then I have had a far  less enjoyable stint 
          as a chef but my enthusiasm for cooking has not deminised.
        </P><br>
        <p>I enjoy throwing semi lavish dinner parties for friends and self catering social events I organise. This is in addition to 
          my much maligned determination to experiment with dishes. I can recall a specific time I forced myself and my partner to each 
          ham hocks for about two weeks while I perfected a recipie.

        <h4>Computers</h4>
        <p>This was again a surprisingly late addition to my interests. My parents were never particularly computer literate and we 
          only owned the one pc for many years. The first pc I had was probably in about 2004, at around the same time I got my first 
          console, the PS2. I used the computer to run World of Warcraft, which it did not do a good job of. 
        </p><br>
        <p>Thus started my interest in computers, or rather, the search to be able to play my games at a decent framerate. I bought a 
          computer from a colleague while I worked at currys and this served me well for a while. A few upgrades and assistant from friends 
          got me through untill university when I built my first computer.
        </p><br>
        <p>This computer lasted me for many years, although with notable additions of a full water loop after some not so educated choices 
          in gpu. The image opposite is one of my misscalculations on my latest build, do not use coloured coolant, it will stain everything.

        <h4>Artistic Endevours</h4>
        <p>At secondary school I took a real interst in art, achieving a 100% score on my art GCSE. While I took a very different path 
          to university and science in general I like exploring my creative side on occasion. 
        </p><br>
        <p>One of these is a hobby of painting miniatures, of which I have a sizable collection. Perhaps one day I will have th space to 
          display them.
        </p><br>
        <p>Pictured opposite was my custom paintjob for my PS4 controller, which still works to this day.</p>

        <h4>Gaming</h4>
        <p>As mentioned in the computer building section, I have a keen interest in games. My first memory of a game is probably playing the old 
          space invaders on my fathers computer when he wasnt using it. It was acceced through command line, before desktops existed, yes I'm old 
          enough to have used a save icon. 
        </p><br>
        <p>After this my next gaming related memory was playing pokemon when it came out, along with their sequels. Thus owning a gameboy and the 
          GBA when it came out. This lead to my first RPG, golden sun and its sequel. After this I "tricked" my parents into buying me a playstation 
          on a family vacation to Ghana, although at this time I still wasnt playing games that often. This would change when I started playing World 
          of Warcraft, and is probably where I can trace my current hobby interest to.
        </p><br>
        <p>Having my own computer allowed me to play much more frequently, and once I built my own functioning computer a few years later, I was free 
          to really broaden my gaming horizons. These days I'm much more selective of the games that I play, valuing games that value my time to them. 
          I.e. not requring playing long hours or tieing me into commitments every day, I have also made some great friends through the social groups 
          that form naturally in these games.
        </p><br>
        <p>Some of these online friends I also choose to see in person, through social events and boardgame nights. I am also currently a Dungeon Master
           in a D&D group and own many board games that I frequently whip out at said social events.

        <h4>Sports</h4>
        <p>Despite my obviously nerdy interests I maintain a very good knowledge of physical sports aswell. This can mostly be attributed to the prep 
          school I attended, Hill House. Instead of usual breaks and lunches, we instead did 2-3 hours a day of mandatory sports. We would often walk 
          over to Hyde Park or the Duke of Yorks barracks to partake in a long list of sports. From this came a good grasp of a large range of rules and 
          basic play techniques of various sports. Of particular interest for me were fencing and cricket, the latter of which I was on the school team 
          for.At my secondary school my interest in sports diminished somewhat, but I did develop an interest in basketball.
        </p><br>
        <p>It wasnt until university that I took up regular team sports again, joining a football team that met regularly and taking up squash with a few
          friends, as well as starting a fairly vigorous gym routine, that sadly I didnt keep up for as long as I should have.
        </p><br>
        <p>Currently I try to run 2-3 days a week, and do other weights on those days as well. When I'm able I also like to play some squash with my partner.</p>
