          <p>here will be a comprehensive list of all the pieces of open source code i have available. with a description of them.
            can also talk about my likes/dislikes in coding and when where i started here? maybe an overall bio. And the link to 
            my general github below:

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <div class="sub-item">This was an assesed project from UCL. After installing the modules from python repositories one could
              ask the program to reccomend the best bus route from various locations. This was all accesible through command line. One could
              also see a number of statistics such as bus route and graphical data on passenger density.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">This was a personal project worked on for my DnD group. The campaign I was working on took place in a cold Tundra
              like environment above the arctic cirlce. Thus I created a simple python program that runs through command line and calculates weather,
              temparture, snowfall and gives the ammount of expected sunlight(if any) on a specified day. 
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">My MSc project code. This code was taken from various papers and adapted to my needs. The project used a machine learning 
              agent from the projective simulation branch of reinforcement learning to optimise surface codes of quantum memory. The agent was free to run a 
              c program that simulated a quantum computers memory. This program would test a surface code and output the results into a txt file that my agent
              wait for and then read. It would then deliberate on the results and output a new command to the surface code program through command line. This 
              would continue until the surface code passed a stability threshold that had been preset, or the number of allowed moves had been passed.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">This was an asssed project from UCL. The tasks was to optimise a mathematical clustering problem from code given to us. We 
              were then asked to run performance analysi between the optimised and non optimised code and out put performance data on it.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">This is a repository with all my practice notebooks from the last few months. Some are from codeacademy or hackerrank
              challanges, some are tests from companies that I wanted to improve on afterwords, all could be much better organised.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-item">This was an assesed project from UCL. These are my High Performance Computing notebooks, specifically ones devoted to 2 optimisation problems. The first was a random
              walk generator over many thousands of steps that I optimised to use multicpu cores in python. The second was a physics equation relating to
              point charges that was similarly optimised.

            <div class="sub-item">This will be an as yet unnamed python project that will use a machine learning agent to suggest new clothes
              to a user from websites.

        <p class="p_thinner">this website is all coded from scratch by myself. No outside creator like square space, wicks or wordpress was used.
          I taught myself it through codeacademy and then used visual studio code to write it all. A github link to the source
          code can be seen <a href = "https://github.com/SandroMoszczynski/Website" id = "normal_link">here</a>.
