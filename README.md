# Website for Sandro Moszczynski

Simple site to show what I can do

## Space for endpoint documentation:

## Still to do:

- update secions for about
- create endpoints for uploading new files (not needed as django has admin panel?)
- create endpoint for refreshing code
- create endpoint for special page
- document endpoints
- setup certbot with https (less important but cool)
- remove debug
