          <p><strong>Key modules:</strong> Quantum Communication, Machine Learning with Big Data, Research with C++ and Python.</p>
          <p>Project focused on applying machine learning techniques to quantum error correction, specifically on working with
            topological codes. The project was based in python with elements extending to C. An algorithm based on projective
            simulation papers was created for use with this project.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="item">
          <div class="sub-item" >For my undergraduate course I studied a wide array of subjects that any course accredited by
            the Institute of Physics should cover. In particular interest to me were the more mathematical
            parts, which I followed into my MSc. These were Quantum field theory and Group theory,
            both of which were used extensively in my Dissertation, which was based on Supersymmetry.
            Also of note are my statistical skills which have been honed over three years of undergraduate
            laboratories and in my MSc course, Data Analysis Techniques. I am also well versed in Solid
            State physics and circuitry having taken both standard and advanced Condensed State Physics.
            The more theoretical subjects have little direct applications to practical systems but do show
            my ability to learn difficult concepts in a short amount of time.</div>
          <div class="sub-item" >For Quantum Field theory and Group theory, a high mathematical ability is required. QFT
            is based in our 4 dimensional world and requires the extensive use of tensors, and Group
            theory makes use of Lie Algebras. Supersymmetry also requires its own notion in the form of
            Superspace and Superfields. On top of more theoretical maths I have also studied statistics
            extensively, having done a masters level course in it.</div>
          <div class="sub-item">I have spent three years in an undergraduate laboratory averaging a high grade. Although my
            MSc was in a more theoretical side of Physics I have realised that working in a laboratory is
            where I am happiest and where I work best. I am able to stay focused for long periods of time
            while focusing on the task at hand.</div>
          <div class="sub-item">During my studies I have been taught both Python and Matlab and have used the former
            extensively in laboratories, being quite fluent in using it for data processing. I have also picked
            up some C++ and am very eager to learn more. I also have considerable knowledge of LATEX.</div>
          <div class="sub-item">I have extensive experience working in teams. This includes working in small teams with
            my partners in my undergraduate laboratories and larger teams before university both as a
            Commis Chef and while spending three years in the Royal Navy Cadets. While working as a
            chef I learned how to be an important part of a unit, with each station working to maximum
            efficiency in order to achieve the collective goals.</div>
          <div class="sub-item">I have given multiple presentations during my time at university, sometimes to packed rooms
            of professors. I have also been the President of the Physics Society and Secretary of the
            Departmental Joint Committee, giving me the ability to both give calm and precise instructions
            and listen to what has been said. Ontop of my dissertation I have also been required to produce
            at least three essays each year for various subjects, and a lab book for each week of laboratory
            work.</div>
          <div class="sub-item">I am bi-lingual being able to speak both Polish and English. My Polish is conversationally
            fluent and English is my mother tongue.</div>
          <div class="sub-item">My time working as a chef has given me the ability to work under bouts of intense pressure,
            while each of my degrees have reinforced my ability to work to a tight deadline, both
            individually and in a team.</div>
          <div class="sub-item">I spend a lot of personal time reading up on topics that interest me and am my own worst
            critic, I have also improved my grade by a boundary from my undergraduate to postgraduate
            degree.</div>
          <div class="sub-item">University life has taught me the value of self motivation. Being able to push oneself to do
            more than just what is required is a skill I pride myself on having, as shown by my multiple
            voluntary positions.</div>
          <div class="sub-item">Leadership Experience: I have spent three years as the President of the Physics Society at Sussex. This time has taught
            me to delegate tasks, to listen to the requests of others and to be able to give quick, decisive
            decisions.</div>
          <div class="sub-item">Community Building: I have been part of many extracurricular activities during my time in education, including a
            leading a society, being the Secretary of a committee and participating in three sports teams. I
            am always interested in meeting new people and finding ways to socialise with colleagues.</div>
