          <li>Msc In Quantum Technologies Merit</li>
          <p>University Collage London Sep 2019 – Sep 2020</p>
          <p><strong>Key modules:</strong> Quantum Communication, Machine Learning with Big Data, Research with C++ and Python.</p>
          <p>Project focused on applying machine learning techniques to quantum error correction, specifically on working with
            topological codes. The project was based in python with elements extending to C. An algorithm based on projective
            simulation papers was created for use with this project.</p>
          <p>External Advisor; Dr. Brian Antao, CEO Tundra Systems.</p>
          <li>Msc In Physics Merit</li>
          <p>University of Sussex Sep 2014 – Sep 2015</p>
          <p><strong>Key modules:</strong> Quantum Field Theory, Symmetries in Particle Physics, Data Analysis Techniques.</p>
          <p>My dissertation took the premise of Supersymmetry and simplified the concepts to a single U(1) gauge, estimates
            of particle content were then made. Subjects taken were mostly theoretical with the exception of Data Analysis
            Techniques.</p>
          <p>Advisor; Dr. Sebastian Jaeger.</p>
          <li>Bsc In Physics Second Class Honours</li>
          <p>University of Sussex Sep 2011 – Sep 2014</p>
          <p><strong>Key modules:</strong> Condensed State Physics, Advanced Condensed state Physics, Scicomp (Python and Matlab).</p>
          <p>The BSc in Physics covered both experimental and theoretical topics with three years of laboratory work.</p>
